    <h1><b>METHODS OF ORGANIC FARMING:</b></h1>
        <p>
            Organic farming methods consolidate scientific ecology and modern technology with conventional farming techniques based on biological processes. Organic farming techniques are considered in the field of agroecology.

            <br>The primary methods incorporate crop rotation, green manures and compost, biological pest control, and mechanical refinement. These measures practice the natural environment to improve agricultural fertility.
            <br>
            <br><b> 1. Crop Diversity:</b><br>
            Crop diversity is referred to as plant genetic resources for food and agriculture, embraces diversity within and amongst crops, their wild relatives and wild edible plant species. It mainly provides the biological foundation for food production and food security and contributes to economic development. It refers to crops and varieties that farmers cultivate and use as part of their subsistence.
            <br><b>2. Crop Rotation: </b><br>
            Crop rotation is the technique of planting crops in the event area of the garden so that no single crop will be planted in the identical place two or more years in a row. Crop rotation assists maintain soil structure and nutrient levels and inhibit soil-borne pests from obtaining a foothold in the garden. However, when a single crop is planted in the related place every year, the soil composition slowly deteriorates as the nutrients are practiced time and time again.
            <br><b>3. Biological Pest Control:</b><br>
            The agricultural field includes a compound of organisms, some utilized for plant cultivation, and a few are damaging. The development of these organisms should be under control to guarantee the security of the field and the crops. Pesticides and herbicides that include some chemicals or natural can be practiced for pest control. A method in which existence organisms are managed to regulate pests without or with restricted usage of chemicals.
            <br><b>4. Soil Management:</b><br>
            After crop cultivation, the soil wastes its nutrients and its exhausts condition. Organic farming begins the performance of natural approaches to improve the health of the ground. It concentrates on bacteria existing in animal waste, which assists deliver the soil nutrients prolific to improve the soil.
            <br><b>5. Green Manure:</b><br>
            It refers to the dying plants extracted and packed into the soil to obtain them act as a nutrient for the soil to enhance its characteristic. Green undecomposed substance applied as manure is recognized as green manure. It is accomplished by developing green manure crops or assembling green leaf from shrubs produced in wastelands, field bunds, and forests.
            
            Green manuring is developing in the meadow plants, referring to the leguminous family and consolidating the soil behind adequate completion. And, the significant green manure products are cluster beans, sunn hemp, dhaincha, pillipesara, and Sesbania rostrata.
            <br><b>6. Compost:</b><br>
            Compost is extremely productive in nutrients, and this is a recycled organic material used as a fertilizer in agricultural fields. Compost farming converts raw organic deposits into humus-like substances through the movement of soil microorganisms. Prepared compost reserves are strong and biologically steady, free of offensive odors, more relaxed to handle, and less massive than raw organic trash.
