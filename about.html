    <h1><b>ORGANIC FARMING:</b></h1>
   <P> 
        * Organic farming is a sustainable agricultural system that emphasizes the use of ecologically based pest controls and biological fertilizers.<br>
        * It combines a high level of biodiversity with environmental practices that preserve natural resources and has rigorous standards for animal welfare<br>
        * It derived largely from animal and plant wastes and nitrogen-fixing cover crops. Modern organic farming was developed as a response to the environmental harm caused by the use of chemical pesticides and synthetic fertilizers in conventional agriculture, and it has numerous ecological benefits.
        <br>* Compared with conventional agriculture, organic farming uses fewer pesticides, reduces soil erosion, decreases nitrate leaching into groundwater and surface water, and recycles animal wastes back into the farm. These benefits are counterbalanced by higher food costs for consumers and generally lower yields. Indeed, yields of organic crops have been found to be about 25 percent lower overall than conventionally grown crops, although this can vary considerably depending upon the type of crop. The challenge for future organic agriculture will be to maintain its environmental benefits, increase yields, and reduce prices while meeting the challenges of climate change and an increasing world population.
        <br>
         <br><b> * Key features of organic farming include:<br></b>
            1  Use of organic fertilizers such as compost manure, green manure, and bone meal.<br>
              2  Crop rotation and companion planting techniques.<br>
              3  Avoidance of chemical fertilizers and pesticides

      <h1><b>BENEFITS:</b></h1>
      <p> #  No chemicals for resistance to pests and diseases, which supports healthier soil and pollinators.<br>
          #  Does not use genetically-modified food items, which produces healthier food for consumers.<br>
          #  A healthy environment for the farmers to work, as they are not exposed to harmful pesticides and herbicides.<br>
          #  Offers profitable niche crop opportunities to organic farmers, as they can charge higher premiums for their products.<br>
          #  The eco-friendly method of cultivation, which has a more sustainable impact on the environment around us</p>
