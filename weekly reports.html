WEEK- 1 (From 13-05-2024 to 18-05-2024)<br>
<b>Objective of the Activity Done: Organic Farming on Lady’s finger</b><br>
<b>Detailed Report:</b><br>
<b>DAY 1: SOWING:</b>
Soil preparation: Loosened soil and added organic compost.
•	Seed selection: Chose high-quality, disease-resistant organic lady's finger seeds.
•		Sowing method: Seeds sown directly into the soil, spacing them appropriately (about 12-18 inches apart).
•	Irrigation: Light watering to keep the soil moist.
<br>
<b>DAY 2: GERMINATION BEGINS:</b>
•	Monitoring: Checked soil moisture and ensured it remained slightly moist.
•	Pest control: Inspected for pests, applied neem oil spray as a preventive measure.
<br>
<b>DAY 3: EARLY GERMINATION:</b>
•	Irrigation: Light watering in the morning.
•	Pest control: Continued monitoring for pests, no application needed.
<br>
<b>DAY 4: SEEDLING DEVELOPMENT:</b>
•	Irrigation: Ensured consistent moisture without waterlogging.
•	Soil management: Added a thin layer of mulch to retain moisture.
<br>
<b>DAY 5: GROWTH PROGRESS:</b>
•	Irrigation: Light watering.
•	Fertilization: Applied diluted organic fertilizer (e.g., compost tea).
<br>
<b>DAY 6: ESTABLISHMENT OF SEEDLINGS:</b>
•	Irrigation: Light watering in the morning.
•	Pest control: Inspected plants; no pests found, neem oil reapplication scheduled in 3 days if needed.
•	Support: Added small stakes to support growing seedlings if necessary.

    WEEK - 2 (From 20-05-2024 to 25-05-2024)<br>

<b>objective of the Activity Done: Organic forming on Mangoes</b><br>
<b>Detailed Report:</b><br>
    <b>DAY 1: PREPARATION AND SOIL HEALTH ASSESSMENT:</b>
-	Soil testing to check pH, nutrient levels, and microbial activity.
-	Clearing the field of any previous crop residue.
-	Application of organic compost to enhance soil fertility.
<br>
<b>DAY 2: SELECTION AND PLANTING OF MANGOES:</b>
-	Selection of disease-resistant and high-yield organic mango saplings.
-	Planting the saplings with appropriate spacing to ensure good air circulation and sunlight exposure.
.<br>
<b>DAY 3: IRRIGATION AND MULCHING:</b>
-	Setting up a drip irrigation system to provide consistent moisture.
-	Applying organic mulch around the base of each sapling to retain soil moisture and suppress weeds.
.<br>
<b>DAY 4: PEST AND DISEASE MANAGEMENT:</b>
-	Monitoring for pests and diseases.
-	Applying neem oil and other organic pesticides to prevent infestations.
<br>
<b>DAY 5: NUTRIENT MANAGEMENT:</b>
-	Application of organic fertilizers, such as compost tea and fish emulsion, to promote healthy growth.
-	Foliar feeding to provide essential micronutrients directly to the leaves.
.<br>
<b>DAY 6: TRAINING AND PRUNING:</b>
-	Initial training of the saplings to promote a strong central leader.
-	Pruning of any damaged or diseased branches to encourage healthy growth.<br>

    WEEK – 3 (From 27-05-2024 to01-06-2024)<br>

   <b> Objective of the activity done: ORGANIC FARMING ON JACKFRUIT</b><br>
    <b>Detailed Report:</b><br>
    
    <b>DAY 1: PREPARATION AND PLANTING:</b>
      Site Selection: Chose a well-drained area with adequate sunlight exposure.
      Soil Preparation: Conducted soil testing to ensure pH levels were between 5.5 and 7.5.  
      Added organic compost to improve soil fertility.
      Seedling Selection: Selected healthy, disease-free jackfruit seedlings.
    Planting: Planted the seedlings at a spacing of 8-10 meters to allow for sufficient growth and air  circulation. Watered the plants thoroughly after planting.
    
    <br><b> DAY 2: MULCHING AND INITIAL CARE:</b>
      Mulching: Applied a thick layer of organic mulch (straw, dried leaves) around the base of
      the plants to retain moisture and suppress weeds.
      Watering: Continued to water the plants lightly to maintain soil moisture without 
      waterlogging.
      Shade: Installed temporary shading structures to protect young seedlings from intense sun.
    
      <br> <b> DAY 3: NUTRIENT MANAGEMENT:</b>
      Organic Fertilizers: Applied a mix of well-decomposed cow manure and vermicompost
       around the base of each plant.
      Foliar Spray: Prepared a foliar spray using diluted neem oil and seaweed extract to provide 
       essential micronutrients and pest protection.
       <br> <b> DAY 4: PASTE AND DISEASE MONITORING:</b>
      Inspection: Conducted a thorough inspection of the plants for any signs of pests or diseases.
      Biological Control: Introduced beneficial insects (like ladybugs) to control potential pest
      populations.
      Neem Oil Spray: Applied a neem oil spray to the leaves to prevent fungal infections and 
       pests.
       <br> <b>DAY 5: IRRIGATION AND WEED CONTROL:</b>
      Irrigation: Ensured that the plants received a consistent but moderate amount of water.
      Weed Control: Manually removed any emerging weeds around the plant base to reduce 
      competition for nutrients.
    
      <br><b>DAY 6: GROWTH MONITORING AND SOIL HEALTH:</b>
      Growth Assessment: Measured plant height and checked for new leaf growth as indicators 
      of plant health.
      Soil Health Check: Tested soil moisture levels and checked for any signs of nutrient
      deficiencies.
      Compost Tea: Applied compost tea to enrich the soil with beneficial microorganisms and 
      enhance nutrient availability.<br>
