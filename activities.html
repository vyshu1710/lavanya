            <b>->Soil preparation</b><br>
            Soil preparation is the process of preparing soil for planting by loosening, aerating, and amending it to create a conducive growing environment. This typically involves:

            <br> 1. Removing debris, rocks, and weeds
           <br>2. Tillage or digging to loosen compacted soil
            <br>3. Adding organic matter like compost or manure to improve fertility and structure
            <br>4. Mixing in fertilizers or amendments as needed
            <br>5. Leveling and raking to create a smooth, even surface<br>

            <b>->Sowing </b><br>
            Sowing is the process of planting seeds into the prepared soil. It's a crucial step in gardening and farming, and involves:

            <br>1. Choosing high-quality seeds suitable for your climate and soil type
            <br>2. Planting seeds at the correct depth and spacing
            <br>3. Covering seeds with soil and gently firming it
            <br>4. Watering seeds adequately to initiate germination
            <br>5. Providing adequate sunlight, warmth, and care for optimal growth<br>
           <b>->Manuring</b><br>
           Manuring is the process of adding organic matter, such as animal waste (manure) or compost, to the soil to improve its fertility and structure. This natural fertilizer:

           <br>1. Provides essential nutrients for plant growth
           <br>2. Improves soil structure and water-holding capacity
           <br>3. Supports beneficial microbial activity
           <br>4. Enhances soil's water retention and aeration
           <br>5. Promotes healthy root development and plant growth<br>

            <b>->Irrigation</b><br>
           irrigation is the artificial application of water to soil to support plant growth and development. It involves:

           <br>1. Supplying water to crops through various systems (sprinkler, drip, flood, etc.)
           <br>2. Replenishing soil moisture lost through evapotranspiration
           <br>3. Helping plants overcome drought and water stress
           <br>4. Enhancing nutrient availability and uptake
           <br>5. Supporting healthy plant growth, yield, and quality<br>

            <b>->Weeding</b><br>
            Weeding is the process of removing unwanted plants, also known as weeds, from a garden, field, or landscape. Weeds compete with desired plants for:

            <br>1. Water<br>
2. Nutrients<br>
3. Light<br>
4. Space<br>

<b>Weeding helps to:</b><br>

1. Reduce competition for resources<br>
2. Prevent weed seeds from spreading<br>
3. Improve soil quality and structure<br>
4. Enhance plant growth and productivity<br>
5. Maintain aesthetic appeal<br>

<b>Common weeding methods include:</b><br>

1. Hand-pulling or digging<br>
2. Hoeing or cultivating<br>
3. Mulching or covering<br>
4. Using herbicides (chemical or organic)<br>
5. Flame weeding (using heat to kill weeds)<br>

            <b>->Harvesting</b><br>
            Harvesting is the process of gathering mature crops or plants from the field, garden, or orchard, typically at the peak of their ripeness and quality. It involves:

            <br> 1. Cutting, picking, or digging up crops<br>
2. Collecting and gathering produce<br>
3. Sorting and grading by size, quality, and ripeness<br>
4. Cleaning and preparing for storage, transport, or market<br>
5. Ending the growth cycle and clearing the land for future planting<br>

            <b>->Storage</b><br>
            Storage refers to the holding and preservation of harvested crops, produce, or goods in a controlled environment to maintain their quality, freshness, and viability. The goals of storage are to:
            <br>1. Protect from spoilage, decay, or damage
            2. Preserve nutritional value and flavor<br>
            3. Maintain texture and appearance<br>
            4. Store efficiently to minimize space and costs<br>
            5. Keep products accessible for future use or sale<br>
